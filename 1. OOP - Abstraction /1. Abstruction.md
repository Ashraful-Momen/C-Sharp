# ✅ C# OOP Notes with Simple Code

---

## ✅ Why Use **Abstract Class**:

* Use when we need a **common base class**, but some methods need to be **changed** in child classes.
* Helps in **partial implementation**.
* Can contain **fields, constructors, properties, and methods**.
* Cannot be instantiated directly.

```csharp
abstract class Animal // Abstract Class
{
    public abstract void Sound(); // Abstract Method (No Body)

    public void Sleep() => Console.WriteLine("Sleeping...");
}

class Dog : Animal // Concrete Class (Inherits Abstract)
{
    public override void Sound() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
}
```

---

## ✅ **Concrete Class**:

* A class that **inherits an abstract class** or implements an interface.
* Provides full implementation of abstract/interface methods.

```csharp
// Dog is a concrete class above because it inherits Animal.
```

---

## ✅ **Abstract Class** (Summary):

* Contains **abstract methods** (must be overridden in child classes).
* Can also have **normal methods** with body.
* Abstract methods **must be fully implemented** in derived class (no partial implementation).
* Allows **fields, properties, and constructors**.

## ✅ ✅ Key Points of **Abstract Class**:

| Feature                                 | Abstract Class |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Can have fields/variables?              | ✅ Yes          |
| Can have method body?                   | ✅ Yes          |
| Constructors Allowed?                   | ✅ Yes          |
| Multiple inheritance?                   | ❌ No           |
| Must override abstract method in child? | ✅ Yes          |

---

## ✅ **Interface**:

* Only contains **method declarations** (no variables or constructors allowed).
* Used for **flexibility and multiple inheritance**.
* All methods are **implicitly public and abstract**.
* Naming convention starts with `I` (Example: `IPayment`).

```csharp
interface IPayment
{
    void Pay();
}

class PaypalPayment : IPayment
{
    public void Pay() => Console.WriteLine("Paid with PayPal");
}
```

---

## ✅ ✅ Key Points of **Interface**:

| Feature                         | Interface                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Can have fields/variables?      | ❌ No (Only constants allowed)             |
| Can have method body?           | ❌ No (Only declaration)                   |
| Constructors Allowed?           | ❌ No                                      |
| Multiple inheritance?           | ✅ Yes (Can implement multiple interfaces) |
| Must override methods in child? | ✅ Yes (all methods)                       |

---

## ✅ **Difference Between Abstract Class & Interface**:

| Feature          | Abstract Class                               | Interface                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Fields/Variables | ✅ Allowed (Fields, Properties)               | ❌ Not allowed (Only constants)             |
| Methods          | ✅ Both abstract and normal methods allowed   | ❌ Only abstract methods (no body)          |
| Constructors     | ✅ Yes                                        | ❌ No                                       |
| Inheritance      | ❌ Only Single (1 Abstract class per child)   | ✅ Multiple inheritance supported           |
| Purpose          | For shared behavior + forced method override | For strict contract & multiple inheritance |

## ✅ Context:

* Meaning: A **block of code** or a code segment.
* Example:

```csharp
{
    Console.WriteLine("This is a code block.");
}
```

---

## ✅ **Strategy Design Pattern**:

* Add new features **without changing old code**.
* Often uses Interfaces.

```csharp
interface IPaymentStrategy
{
    void Pay();
}

class CreditCard : IPaymentStrategy
{
    public void Pay() => Console.WriteLine("Paid with Credit Card");
}

class PaymentContext
{
    private IPaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public PaymentContext(IPaymentStrategy strategy)
    {
        paymentStrategy = strategy;
    }

    public void ProcessPayment() => paymentStrategy.Pay();
}
```

---

## ✅ **SOLID Principle** (Summary):

**S** - Single Responsibility
**O** - Open/Closed
**L** - Liskov Substitution
**I** - Interface Segregation
**D** - Dependency Inversion

---

### ✅ **Interface Segregation Principle**:

> Don’t force a class to implement methods it doesn’t need.

```csharp
interface IPrinter
{
    void Print();
}

interface IScanner
{
    void Scan();
}

class SimplePrinter : IPrinter
{
    public void Print() => Console.WriteLine("Printing...");
}
```

---

## ✅ **DRY**: *(Don't Repeat Yourself)*

* Avoid repeating code.

```csharp
// Bad (Repetition)
Console.WriteLine("Hello");
Console.WriteLine("Hello");

// Good (Reuse)
void Greet() => Console.WriteLine("Hello");
Greet();
Greet();
```

---

## ✅ **YAGNI** *(You Aren’t Gonna Need It)*:

> Don’t add features until necessary.

```csharp
// ❌ Bad: Adding unused function
void FutureFeature() { /* unused */ }

// ✅ Good: Add only when needed
```

---

### ✅ ✅ Final Summary:

| Concrete Class   | Class that inherits abstract/interface                                              |
| Interface        | Only methods (no fields), allows multiple inheritance                               |
| Strategy Pattern | Add new features without modifying old code                                         |
