6. Deep copy vs Shallow copy : 
-------------------------------
suppose we copy a object (this object has so many property and some property use the reference / pointer ) that why object can't fully copy (reason for the reference / pointer) , it's define the shallow copy . 

and copy object properly not use any pointer/reference value in the object , it's define the deep copy .
